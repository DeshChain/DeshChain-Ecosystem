## Technical Implementation

### New Components
1. `/x/tax/keeper/namo_swap_router.go` - NAMO swap functionality

3. `/x/tax/types/tax_calculator.go` - Progressive tax calculation
4. `/x/dinr/keeper/namo_fees.go` - DINR NAMO fee collection
5. `/x/dusd/keeper/namo_fees.go` - DUSD NAMO fee collection

### Modified Components
1. Tax distribution logic updated for new percentages
2. DINR tiered fees updated with ₹830 cap
3. DUSD sustainable fees with volume-based tiers
4. Keeper structures updated to support tax integration

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing transactions continue to work
- New fee structure applies automatically
- Legacy fee parameters deprecated but functional
- Smooth migration path for existing users

## Testing & Validation
- Unit tests for progressive tax calculation
- Integration tests for NAMO swapping
- Distribution validation tests
- Module integration tests
- Backward compatibility tests

## Production Readiness Checklist
