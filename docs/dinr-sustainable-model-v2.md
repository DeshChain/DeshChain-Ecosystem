# DINR Sustainable Model V2 - Realistic & Competitive Design

## Executive Summary

This redesigned model addresses critical flaws, implements realistic yields, competitive fees, and creates sustainable revenue through DeshChain growth rather than unsustainable DeFi yields.

## 1. Core Model Corrections

### 1.1 Fee Structure (Competitive & Capped)

```yaml
DINR Transaction Fees:
  Minting Fee: 0.1% (max ₹100)
  Redemption Fee: 0.1% (max ₹100)
  Transfer Fee: 0% (free transfers)
  
Privacy Transactions:
  Private Mint: 0.5% (max ₹500)
  Private Transfer: 0.3% (max ₹300)
  Private Redeem: 0.5% (max ₹500)

Gas Costs (Paid in NAMO):
  Standard Transaction: ₹10-50
  Complex Transaction: ₹50-200
  Maximum Cap: ₹1000
  
Competitive Analysis:
  USDT: 0.1% uncapped
  USDC: 0% fees
  DINR: 0.1% capped at ₹100 ✓
```

### 1.2 Realistic Yield Model

```yaml
Gram Suraksha Pool (Rural):
  Target Returns: 12-15% APY

  Risk: Medium (diversified rural portfolio)
  
Urban Investment Pool:
  Target Returns: 10-12% APY
  Source:
    - Business lending (14-16% returns)
