# DINR Stablecoin: Complete Financial Analysis & Mechanics

## Executive Summary

DINR is an algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the Indian Rupee through crypto-collateralized mechanisms. This analysis covers the burning-minting dynamics, stability mechanisms, launch strategy, and comprehensive financial projections.

## 1. Burning-Minting Mechanism Explained

### 1.1 Core Concept

The DINR system maintains stability through two primary mechanisms:

```
When DINR > ₹1 (Above Peg):
├── Supply needs to EXPAND
├── System MINTS new DINR
├── Selling pressure increases
└── Price returns to ₹1

When DINR < ₹1 (Below Peg):
├── Supply needs to CONTRACT
├── System BURNS existing DINR
├── Buying pressure increases
└── Price returns to ₹1
```

### 1.2 Minting Scenarios

#### A. User-Initiated Minting (Primary)
```
User deposits $1000 USDT (₹83,000 equivalent)
↓
At 150% collateral ratio
↓
User can mint 55,333 DINR
↓
New DINR enters circulation
```

**Revenue Model**:
- 0.5% minting fee = 276.67 DINR
- User receives: 55,056.33 DINR
- Platform revenue: ₹276.67

#### B. Algorithmic Minting (Stability)
```
Market price: 1 DINR = ₹1.02 (2% above peg)
↓
Arbitrage opportunity detected
↓
System mints new DINR to stability pool
↓
Arbitrageurs buy DINR at ₹1.00, sell at ₹1.02
↓
Selling pressure brings price back to ₹1.00
```

### 1.3 Burning Scenarios

#### A. User-Initiated Burning (Redemption)
```
User has 10,000 DINR debt
↓
User burns 10,000 DINR
↓
System releases $180 of collateral (at 150% ratio)
↓
DINR removed from circulation
```

**Fee Structure**:
- 0.3% redemption fee = 30 DINR
- Collateral returned: $179.46
- Platform revenue: ₹30

#### B. Algorithmic Burning (Stability)
```
Market price: 1 DINR = ₹0.98 (2% below peg)
↓
System uses reserve funds to buy DINR
↓
Purchased DINR is burned
↓
Reduced supply increases price to ₹1.00
```

#### C. Liquidation Burning
```
User position falls below 130% ratio
↓
Liquidator repays 10,000 DINR debt
↓
10,000 DINR burned from supply
↓
Liquidator receives collateral at 10% discount
```

### 1.4 Mathematical Model

```python
# Simplified stability algorithm
def calculate_mint_burn(current_price, target_price=1.0):
    deviation = (current_price - target_price) / target_price
    
    if abs(deviation) < 0.01:  # Within 1% - no action
        return 0
    
    # Calculate adjustment amount
    current_supply = get_total_supply()
    
    if deviation > 0:  # Above peg - mint
        # Mint proportional to deviation
        mint_amount = current_supply * deviation * 0.1  # 10% of deviation
        return mint_amount
    else:  # Below peg - burn
        # Burn proportional to deviation
        burn_amount = current_supply * abs(deviation) * 0.1
        return -burn_amount
```

## 2. Stability Balancing Mechanisms

### 2.1 Multi-Layer Stability Framework

#### Layer 1: Market Incentives
```
Price > Peg → Mint & Sell profitable → Supply increases → Price falls
Price < Peg → Buy & Redeem profitable → Supply decreases → Price rises
```

#### Layer 2: Collateral Ratio Adjustment
```
High Demand Period:
- Lower ratio from 150% to 140%
- Easier to mint new DINR
- Increases supply

Low Demand Period:
- Raise ratio from 150% to 160%
- Harder to mint new DINR
- Constrains supply
```

#### Layer 3: Fee Adjustments
```
Dynamic Fee Model:
if price > 1.01:
    minting_fee = 0.3%  # Reduced to encourage minting
    redemption_fee = 0.7%  # Increased to discourage redemption
elif price < 0.99:
    minting_fee = 0.7%  # Increased to discourage minting
    redemption_fee = 0.3%  # Reduced to encourage redemption
else:
    minting_fee = 0.5%  # Normal
    redemption_fee = 0.5%  # Normal
```

#### Layer 4: Direct Market Operations
```
Stability Reserve Actions:
- Buy DINR when < ₹0.98
- Sell DINR when > ₹1.02
- Use 20% of platform revenues for stability operations
```

### 2.2 Time-Based Controls

```yaml
Expansion Limits:
  Hourly: Max 1% supply increase
  Daily: Max 5% supply increase
  Weekly: Max 15% supply increase

Contraction Limits:
  Hourly: Max 1% supply decrease
  Daily: Max 5% supply decrease
  Weekly: Max 15% supply decrease

Rationale: Prevents manipulation and flash loan attacks
```
