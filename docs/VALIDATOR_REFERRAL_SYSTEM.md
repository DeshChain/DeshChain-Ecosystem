# DeshChain Validator Referral System

## Overview

The DeshChain Validator Referral System allows Genesis validators (ranks 1-21) to refer new validators (ranks 22-1000) and earn commission on their generated revenue. This system includes comprehensive anti-gaming measures and auto-launches validator tokens on the Sikkebaaz platform.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ReferralKeeper** - Main referral operations handler
2. **ReferralValidator** - Anti-gaming validation and security
3. **SikkebaazIntegration** - Token launch automation
4. **StakingManager** - USD-pegged staking with security measures

### Data Flow

```
Genesis Validator → Create Referral → Validation → New Validator Stakes → 
Referral Activation → Commission Processing → Token Launch (if eligible)
```

## Referral Eligibility & Limits

### Genesis Validator Requirements
- Must own a Genesis NFT (ranks 1-21)
- Must have active validator stake
- No referral violations in history

### Referral Limits
- **Global**: 100 total referrals per validator
- **Monthly**: 5 referrals maximum
- **Weekly**: 2 referrals maximum  
- **Time Gap**: Minimum 24 hours between referrals

### Rank Allocation
- **Available Ranks**: 22-1000 (979 total slots)
- **Assignment**: First-come, first-served basis
- **Validation**: Automatic rank availability check

## Commission Structure

### Tier-Based Commission Rates

| Tier | Referral Count | Commission Rate | Token Bonus | Badge NFT |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | 0-10 | 10% | None | None |
| 2 | 11-25 | 12% | 1,000 tokens | Bronze Recruiter |
| 3 | 26-50 | 15% | 5,000 tokens | Silver Recruiter |
| 4 | 51-100 | 20% | 10,000 tokens | Gold Recruiter |

### Commission Payment Schedule
- **Cliff Period**: 6 months from referral activation
- **Payment Duration**: First year only (12 months)
- **Payment Method**: As liquidity in validator's auto-launched token
- **Platform Fee**: 5% deducted from commission

## Auto-Launch Token System

### Launch Triggers
Validator tokens are automatically launched when either condition is met:
- **5+ Active Referrals** OR
- **₹50 Lakh+ Commission Earned**

### Token Specifications
```go
ValidatorToken{
    TotalSupply: 1_000_000_000 tokens (1 billion)
    Decimals: 6
    Name: "[NFT Name] Coin"
    Symbol: Auto-generated from NFT name
}
```

### Token Distribution
- **Validator Control**: 40% (2-year vesting)
- **Referral Liquidity**: 30% (permanent lock for commissions)
- **Community Airdrops**: 15% (validator controlled)
- **Development Fund**: 10% (1-year vesting)
- **Initial Liquidity**: 5% (immediate trading)

### Anti-Dump Mechanisms
- **Max Wallet**: 2% of total supply per address
- **Max Transaction**: 0.5% of total supply per transaction
- **Sell Tax**: 5% (60% liquidity, 30% validator, 10% platform)
- **Buy Tax**: 2% (same distribution)
- **Cooldown**: 1 hour between transactions
- **Launch Protection**: 24-hour enhanced protection

## Anti-Gaming Measures

### IP Clustering Prevention
- Hash IP addresses for privacy
- Maximum 2 referrals per IP subnet per week
- Cross-referral IP validation
- Suspicious pattern detection

### Wallet Clustering Detection
- Transaction history analysis between referrer/referred
- Minimum address age requirement (7 days)
- Minimum on-chain activity validation
- Sybil attack prevention

### Pattern Analysis
- **Timing Clusters**: Detects > 3 referrals within 1 hour
- **Sequential Addresses**: Flags systematic address generation
- **Uniform Stakes**: Identifies suspiciously similar stake amounts
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Historical validator performance tracking

### Time-Based Restrictions
- 24-hour minimum gap between referrals
- Monthly and weekly limits enforcement
- Commission cliff period (6 months)
- Annual commission window (12 months only)

## Security Framework

### USD-Pegged Staking
```go
// Stakes locked at USD value forever
stake := ValidatorStake{
    OriginalUSDValue: usdAmount,
    NAMOStaked: CalculateNAMORequired(usdAmount, currentNAMOPrice),
    NAMOPrice: currentNAMOPrice, // Locked forever
    StakingTime: blockTime,
}
```

### Performance Bonds
- **Tier 1 (1-10)**: 30% of stake permanently locked
- **Tier 2 (11-20)**: 25% of stake permanently locked  
- **Tier 3 (21+)**: 20% of stake permanently locked
- **Release**: After 3 years minimum

### Slashing Protection
- **Technical Violations**: 5-15% slash rate
- **Economic Violations**: 25-50% slash rate
- **Referral Abuse**: Up to 75% slash rate
- **Insurance Pool**: Community coverage up to $500K per validator

### Circuit Breakers
- **5% Price Drop**: 1-hour trading pause
- **10% Price Drop**: 4-hour trading pause
- **20% Price Drop**: 24-hour trading pause
- **Emergency Protocol**: Manual intervention capability

## Clawback Mechanism

### Clawback Triggers
- Referred validator exits within 1 year
- Referral violations discovered
- Fraudulent activity detection
- Performance bond forfeiture

### Clawback Process
```go
func processClawback(referral Referral, reason string) {
    clawbackAmount := referral.PaidCommission
    referral.Status = ReferralStatusClawedBack
    referral.ClawbackAmount = clawbackAmount
    referral.ClawbackReason = reason
    
    // Update stats and emit events
    updateReferrerStats(referral.ReferrerAddr, -clawbackAmount)
    emitClawbackEvent(referral, reason)
}
```
