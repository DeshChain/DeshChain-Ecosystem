# DINR Global Model V3 - With Remittance & Cross-Chain Protocol

## Executive Summary

Enhanced DINR model incorporating global remittance protocol and cross-chain conversion, targeting the $700B+ remittance market with focus on India's $100B+ annual inflows.

## 1. Global Remittance Protocol

### 1.1 Core Architecture

```yaml
DeshRemit Protocol:
  
  Traditional Remittance:
    USA → India: $100 sent
    Bank Wire: 3-5 days, $25 fee (25%)
    WU/MoneyGram: 1-3 days, $8-15 fee (8-15%)
    
  DeshRemit Flow:
    USA → India: $100 sent
    Step 1: USD → USDC (instant, $0.1)
    Step 2: USDC → DINR (instant, 0.1%)
    Step 3: DINR → INR (instant, 0.1%)
    Total: <5 minutes, $0.3 fee (0.3%)
    Savings: 96%+ vs traditional
```

### 1.2 Remittance Corridors

```yaml
Priority Corridors (Phase 1):
  USA → India: $40B/year
  UAE → India: $20B/year  
  UK → India: $5B/year
  Singapore → India: $4B/year
  Canada → India: $3B/year
  
Expansion Corridors (Phase 2):
  Saudi Arabia → India: $8B/year
  Australia → India: $2B/year
  Europe → India: $5B/year
  
Reverse Corridors (Phase 3):
  India → Bangladesh
  India → Nepal
  India → Sri Lanka
  India → Philippines
```

        uint256 amount,
        string memory sourceCurrency
    ) external returns (bytes32 orderId) {
        // Verify corridor is active
        Corridor memory corridor = corridors[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sourceCurrency, "INR"))];
        require(corridor.active, "Corridor not active");
        require(amount >= corridor.minAmount && amount <= corridor.maxAmount, "Amount out of range");
        
        // Calculate DINR amount
        uint256 dinrAmount = oracle.convertToDINR(amount, sourceCurrency);
        uint256 fee = (dinrAmount * corridor.fee) / 10000;
        uint256 netDINR = dinrAmount - fee;
        
        // Create order
        orderId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, recipientKYC, block.timestamp));
        orders[orderId] = RemittanceOrder({
            sender: msg.sender,
            recipientKYC: recipientKYC,
            sourceAmount: amount,
            sourceCurrency: sourceCurrency,
            dinrAmount: netDINR,

            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            status: RemittanceStatus.PENDING
        });
        
        // Lock sender's funds
        IERC20(getTokenAddress(sourceCurrency)).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
