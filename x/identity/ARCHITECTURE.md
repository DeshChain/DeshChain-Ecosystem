# DeshChain Identity System Architecture

## Overview

The DeshChain Identity System is a comprehensive, production-ready decentralized identity solution that implements W3C DID standards, Verifiable Credentials, and privacy-preserving authentication mechanisms. It provides seamless integration with existing KYC/AML and biometric systems while enabling self-sovereign identity for all DeshChain users.

## Core Principles

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users control their identity data
2. **Privacy by Design**: Zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure
3. **Standards Compliance**: W3C DID, VC, and DIDComm protocols
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing modules
5. **India Stack Ready**: Native support for Aadhaar, DigiLocker, and e-KYC
6. **Offline Capable**: Works in low-connectivity rural areas
7. **Multi-Language**: Supports all 22 official Indian languages

## Architecture Components

### 1. DID Layer
- **DID Registry**: On-chain registry for DID documents
- **DID Resolution**: Fast resolution with caching
- **DID Methods**: Support for did:desh and did:web
- **Key Management**: Hierarchical deterministic keys with recovery

### 2. Verifiable Credentials Layer
- **Credential Issuance**: Standards-compliant VC issuance
- **Credential Verification**: Privacy-preserving verification
- **Credential Schemas**: Extensible schema registry
- **Selective Disclosure**: Zero-knowledge proof based

### 3. KYC/AML Integration Layer
- **KYC Orchestration**: Unified KYC workflow engine
- **AML Screening**: Real-time sanctions and PEP checks
- **Risk Scoring**: ML-based risk assessment
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated regulatory reporting

### 4. Biometric Integration Layer
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Fingerprint, face, iris, voice
- **Privacy Protection**: Template protection and encryption
- **Liveness Detection**: Anti-spoofing mechanisms
- **Consent Management**: GDPR-compliant consent flows

### 5. India Stack Integration
- **Aadhaar Bridge**: Secure Aadhaar authentication
- **DigiLocker Integration**: Document verification
- **UPI Identity**: Payment identity verification
- **e-KYC Services**: Paperless KYC flows

### 6. Privacy & Security Layer
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving authentication
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Compute on encrypted data
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation**: Distributed verification
- **Trusted Execution Environment**: Hardware-based security

### 7. Storage Layer
- **On-Chain Storage**: DID documents and revocation lists
- **Off-Chain Storage**: Encrypted credentials on IPFS
- **Local Storage**: Identity wallet with secure enclave
- **Backup & Recovery**: Encrypted cloud backups

## Data Flow

```
User Registration Flow:
1. User creates identity wallet
2. Wallet generates DID and keypair
3. DID registered on-chain
4. KYC credentials issued by authorized verifiers
5. Biometric templates enrolled with privacy protection
6. Credentials stored in encrypted wallet

Authentication Flow:
1. Service requests authentication
2. User presents DID
3. Service requests specific credentials
4. User approves selective disclosure
5. Zero-knowledge proof generated
6. Service verifies proof without seeing raw data
```

## Module Integration

### Trade Finance Module

## Security Model

1. **Cryptographic Security**
   - Ed25519 for signing
   - X25519 for encryption
   - BLS for aggregation
   - SHA3 for hashing

2. **Access Control**
   - Capability-based access
   - Delegation chains
   - Time-bound permissions
   - Revocation mechanisms

3. **Privacy Protection**
   - Minimal disclosure
   - Unlinkable presentations
   - Anonymous credentials
   - Differential privacy

## Compliance Framework

1. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - GDPR/DPDP Act compliance
   - RBI KYC guidelines
   - UIDAI regulations
   - International standards

2. **Audit Trail**
   - Immutable audit logs
   - Compliance reporting
   - Privacy-preserving analytics
   - Real-time monitoring

## Performance Targets

- DID Resolution: < 50ms
- Credential Verification: < 100ms
- Biometric Matching: < 200ms
- KYC Processing: < 2 seconds
- Throughput: 10,000 TPS for identity operations

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy identity module with basic DID support
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate existing KYC data to VCs
3. **Phase 3**: Enable privacy features
4. **Phase 4**: Full India Stack integration
5. **Phase 5**: Deprecate legacy APIs

## Future Enhancements
