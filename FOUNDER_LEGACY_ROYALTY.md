```
Year 1:  ‚Çπ10 Cr daily volume  = ‚Çπ36.5 Cr yearly = ‚Çπ36.5 Lakhs royalty
Year 3:  ‚Çπ100 Cr daily volume = ‚Çπ365 Cr yearly  = ‚Çπ3.65 Cr royalty
Year 5:  ‚Çπ500 Cr daily volume = ‚Çπ1,825 Cr yearly = ‚Çπ18.25 Cr royalty
Year 10: ‚Çπ1000 Cr daily volume = ‚Çπ3,650 Cr yearly = ‚Çπ36.5 Cr royalty
```

#### Growth Scenarios:
- **Bear Market**: Minimum ‚Çπ1 Cr annual royalty by Year 3
- **Base Case**: ‚Çπ5-10 Cr annual royalty by Year 5
- **Bull Market**: ‚Çπ50+ Cr annual royalty possible

### üîê Legal Framework

#### Smart Contract Implementation:
```solidity
contract FounderRoyalty {
    address public currentBeneficiary;
    address[] public heirs;
    uint256 public constant ROYALTY_RATE = 10; // 0.10%
    uint256 public constant CHANGE_DELAY = 30 days;
    
    mapping(address => uint256) public heirPercentages;
    uint256 public changeRequestTime;
    address public pendingBeneficiary;
    
    modifier onlyBeneficiary() {
        require(msg.sender == currentBeneficiary);
        _;
    }
    
    function designateHeir(address _heir, uint256 _percentage) public onlyBeneficiary {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    function claimInheritance(bytes calldata _proof) public {
        // Legal proof verification
        // Transfer beneficiary rights
    }
}
```
