## üí° Key Insights

1. **Charity Must Be Graduated**: 40% from Day 1 is financial suicide
2. **Fees Must Stay Sustainable**: 0.10% endpoint is unrealistic
3. **DINR Yield Cannot Be Guaranteed**: Must be performance-based
4. **DUSD Is Critical**: Represents 40% of Year 5 revenue
5. **Profitability Takes Time**: Expect losses for 24+ months

## Conclusion

This revised model transforms DeshChain from an idealistic but unsustainable platform to a realistic, profitable blockchain ecosystem that can achieve its social impact goals over time.

**The key principle**: **Survive first, then thrive, then give back at scale.**

By Year 5, DeshChain can distribute ‚Çπ330+ Cr annually to charity while maintaining a healthy, growing business. This is far better than failing in Year 1 with good intentions but poor execution.

**Recommendation**: Adopt this revised model immediately and communicate transparently with stakeholders about the need for pragmatic adjustments to ensure long-term success.
