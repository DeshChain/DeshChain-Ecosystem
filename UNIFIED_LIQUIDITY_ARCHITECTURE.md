## The Magic Formula: One Pool, Three Benefits

```

### Month 13: Maturity & Rotation
```

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
UnifiedLiquidityPool {
    // Automatic allocation
    allocateLiquidity() {
        pensionReserve = total * 20%
        dexLiquidity = total * 30%
        agriLending = total * 40%
        emergency = total * 10%
    }
    
    // Revenue distribution
    distributeReturns() {
        pensionReturns = calculateGuaranteedReturn()
        excessProfit = distributeToVillage()
    }
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **Gram Pension Module**
   - `AfterPensionContribution()`: Adds liquidity
   - `AfterPensionMaturity()`: Processes payouts

2. **Money Order DEX**
   - `RecordDexRevenue()`: Tracks trading fees
   - `ProcessSwap()`: Uses pool liquidity

3. **Kisaan Mitra Lending**
