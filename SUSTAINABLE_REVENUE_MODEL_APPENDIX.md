# DeshChain Sustainable Revenue Model
## Whitepaper Appendix

### Executive Summary

Following comprehensive financial analysis, DeshChain has adopted a sustainable revenue model that ensures long-term platform viability while preserving our social impact mission. This appendix details the revised model that replaces unsustainable initial parameters.

## üéØ Key Changes for Sustainability

### 1. Graduated Charity Allocation

**Previous Model**: 40% of all revenue to charity from Day 1
**Revised Model**: Graduated allocation over 5 years

```yaml
Year 1: 10% of revenue to charity
Year 2: 20% of revenue to charity
Year 3: 30% of revenue to charity
Year 4: 35% of revenue to charity
Year 5+: 40% of revenue to charity

Rationale: Allows platform to achieve profitability and scale before maximizing social impact
```

### 2. Sustainable Transaction Fees

**Previous Model**: 2.5% ‚Üí 0.10% over 2 years
**Revised Model**: Minimum 0.50% with volume discounts

```yaml
Base Fee Structure:
  Standard: 0.50% (sustainable minimum)
  
Volume Discounts:
  > ‚Çπ10 lakh monthly: 0.40%
  > ‚Çπ1 Cr monthly: 0.30%
  > ‚Çπ10 Cr monthly: 0.25% (floor)
  
Rationale: 0.10% endpoint would lead to platform failure within 18 months
```

### 3. DINR Performance-Based Yield

**Previous Model**: 4-6% guaranteed yield
**Revised Model**: 0-8% performance-based yield

```yaml
Yield Calculation Factors:
  Platform Profitability: 40% weight
  Trading Volume Growth: 20% weight
  Lending Book Performance: 20% weight
  DUSD Revenue: 20% weight
  
Distribution: Quarterly, based on actual performance
Rationale: Guaranteed yields are unsustainable without revenue to support them
```

### 4. DINR Tiered Fee Structure

**Previous Model**: 0.1% capped at ‚Çπ100
**Revised Model**: Tiered structure without caps

```yaml
Fee Tiers:
  < ‚Çπ10,000: 0.10% (min ‚Çπ10)
  ‚Çπ10K - ‚Çπ1L: 0.08%
  ‚Çπ1L - ‚Çπ10L: 0.06%
  ‚Çπ10L - ‚Çπ1Cr: 0.04%
  > ‚Çπ1 Cr: 0.02% (no cap)
  
Rationale: Caps severely limit revenue on large transactions
```

### 5. DUSD Sustainable Pricing

**Previous Model**: $0.10 - $1.00 flat fees
**Revised Model**: Volume-based percentage fees

```yaml
DUSD Fee Structure:
  Retail: 0.30% (min $0.10, max $1.00)
  Small Business (>$100K/mo): 0.25%
  Enterprise (>$1M/mo): 0.20%
  Institutional (>$10M/mo): 0.15%
  Market Maker (>$100M/mo): 0.10%
  
Cross-Currency: 0.25% standard
Rationale: Percentage-based fees scale with transaction size
```
